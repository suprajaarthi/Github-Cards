# Github-Cards
Github Cards to display info about the users using React.js

- When we use spread operator with an oject like this in react component , all the properties of the object will become props of that component 
```
<Card {...testData[0]/>
<Card {...testData[1]/>
```
- wheras testdata is a json to define properties like name,email and age of an object
